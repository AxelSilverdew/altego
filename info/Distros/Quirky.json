	"text":"**Quirky** is a sister project of Puppy Linux, a Linux distribution built with a custom tool called Woof. Quirky is developed by the founder of Puppy Linux and Woof to push the envelope a bit further, to explore some new ideas in the underlying infrastructure -- some of which may be radical or odd, hence the name **Quirky.**\n**Notable features**\n- All underlying tools and custom packages of Puppy Linux.\n- Extremely tiny and snappy as per usual Puppy.\n- Great alternative choice for really old and / or underpowered PCs.\n**Available DEs**\n- ROX\n- JWM\n**More info**\nhttp://bkhome.org/quirky/",
