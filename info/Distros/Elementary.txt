**ElementaryOS** is an Ubuntu-based desktop distribution. Some of its more interesting features include a custom desktop environment called Pantheon and many custom apps including Photos, Music, Videos, Calendar, Terminal, Files, and more. It also comes with some familiar apps like the Epiphany web browser and a fork of Geary mail. It is considered to be a very good distro for Linux newbies.

**Noteable Features**
- Pantheon Shell, a lightweight, modular desktop environment primarily written in Vala and GTK+.
- AppCenter, delivers native, Open Source apps to elementary OS. Quickly discover new apps and easily update the ones you already have.
- Plank, the simplest dock on the planet.

**Worth Noting**
Because it is based on Ubuntu, ElementaryOS might not have up to date drivers for hardware. This may lead to newer hardware not working properly with it.
