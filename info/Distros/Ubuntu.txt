**Ubuntu** is a stable release distro focused on being user/beginner friendly with an incredibly usable desktop experience. LTS releases make sure when you throw it on your Granny’s comp that there won’t be a flaw every 5 seconds and to ensure lasting servers, while stable releases as the upcoming 17.10 Artful Aardvark are more focused on actual daily driver use with up to date packages.
**Notable features**
- Apt, simple to use and understand front end to the package manager.
- PPAs, user repositories for third party programs.
- dpkg, the true package manager, allowing incredibly easy installation of .deb files on any debian based system.
- Snapd, snaps are much like flatpak, sandboxed programs designed for any distro.
**Available DEs**
- Unity
- Gnome
- XFCE
- LxDE/QT
- Plasma
- Mate
- Budgie
