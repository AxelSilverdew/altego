In NixOS, the entire operating system, including the kernel, applications, system packages and configuration files, are built by the Nix package manager. Nix stores all packages in isolation from each other; as a result there are no /bin, /sbin, /lib or /usr directories and all packages are kept in /nix/store instead.\n**Notable features**\n- Includes reliable upgrades, rollbacks and reproducible system configurations.\n- Source-based model with binaries, and multi-user package management.\n**Available DEs**\n- Awesome\n- Enlightenment\n- Fluxbox\n- GNOME\n- i3\n- IceWM\n- KDE\n- Ratpoison\n- Xfce\n**More info**\nhttps://nixos.org/",
