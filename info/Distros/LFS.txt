**Linux From Scratch (LFS)** is a project that provides you with the steps necessary to build your own custom Linux system! The most important reason for LFS's existence is teaching people how a Linux system works internally, how things 'tick', how everything depends on each other, and so on.
**Notable features**
- 100's of pages of pure Linux goodness.
**Available DEs**
