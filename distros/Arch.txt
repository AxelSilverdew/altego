**Arch Linux** is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose GNU/Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required.
**Notable features**
- Simplicity, Arch linux comes without unnecessary additions or modifications, and the user adds exactly what he or she may need.
- Modernity, this distribution maintains and releases the latest versions of the software.
- KISS, keep it simple stupid, nothing is overcomplicated and everything should be easy to understand or read up on.
- Arch wiki, probably the most useful tool arch brings to the table. As a vast, easy to use wiki where anything you possibly can wonder about is written down with examples and troubleshooting steps.
