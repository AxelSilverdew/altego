- Zypper, easy to use and powerful Package Manager with many options regarding updating, blocking and installing packages
- OBS, easily build and install your favourite apps for many distributions at the same time
- Snapper, easy to use snapshoting tool to reverse and controll changes on system if required
- Apparmor, security module for mandatory access control to limit programs from abusing power and/or system resources
