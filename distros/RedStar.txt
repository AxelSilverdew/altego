**Red Star OS** is an extremely oppresive North Korean GNU/Linux operating system developed at the Korea Computer Center. New versions are available, but most have remained on v1.0. Glory to Great Leader! 
**Notable features**
- Spies you on overtly.
- Can trace 'fingerprints' to origins for defamation tracking and arresting you on those grounds.
- Costs about $0.25.
- Cannot be modified over desktop looks, doing so carries a penalty.
- Will force reboot on critical system changes.
- Chosŏn'gŭl: 붉은별 - *Pulgŭnbyŏl*.
**Available DEs**
Only KDE 3, originating from Fedora 11. Heavily modified to look like Mac OSX Lion or Windows XP.
