**Gentoo Linux** is a highly customizable rolling-release distribution with a unique source-code based package manager.
**Notable features**
- Versatility. Choose your window manager, init system, and even kernel. With Gentoo, almost every aspect of the system is configurable.
- Either bleeding edge or stable, the choice is yours with Gentoo's optional testing branches.
- Rolling release. Packages can be updated as soon as updates are avalible and (optionally) when they are also fully stable.
- World class hardware support. With downloads for 13 different architectures, Gentoo runs on everything from an Amiga to the IOT kitchen sink.
- Use flags allow you to install software with the minimum possible amount of bloat. Disable program features you will never use to save space and RAM.
- Every program is faster in Gentoo thanks to CPU tuning: Build programs to take advantage of your CPU's quirks.
**Avalible DEs**
All of them.
